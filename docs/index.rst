Link Blockchain
===============

Link is a uncontrolled `linked data <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data>`_ ecosystem living on the blockchain. It is fully public. It cannot be censored and no one can be prevented from participating. It is fully programmable at every level. It is a development platform for interconnected distributed apps that empower the individual.
